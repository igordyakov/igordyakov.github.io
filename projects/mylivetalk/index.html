On the next step I’ll focus on visual style while Konstantin will be busy with building the fundament of the app. Using such parallel approach will allow us to reduce time and focus on things that really matter on each single step.</i></p>

	        <p>At the very beginning user launches the application and the login screen appears. It has branding area at the top, obvious controls under it and some service “links” that will lead to the web part of the service.</p>
            <p>It has four states:</p>

        <h3>Contacts and Home Section</h3>
         <p>Let’s focus on sidebar with contacts at first. In sidebar we display only actual contacts and groups that user has chosen from Home section or had a conversation/notification from them recently.</p>
          <p>Home section contains all contacts and groups with live search.</p>

          <p class="caption">When user chooses any contact/group from the list, it moves to the sidebar and appropriate conversation opens.</p>
          <p>This approach will allow us to keep things clean and simple even for companies with tons of  people and groups. </p>

        <h3>Conversation</h3>
         <p>The most common thing is obviously text messages. Bubbles are being grouped when user is sending chain of messages.</p>

        <p class="mt2">User can choose file through Explorer by clicking on button on the left side of the input field or just drag and drop it into the conversation area.</p>

          <p class="caption">When Kevin clicks Send button, the file and message appear in the conversation area.</p>

          <p class="caption">Text message wasn’t sent due to temporary network problems so he should click on it to retry.</p>
          <p>There are some user details on the top of the conversation area (userpic, status, position, email etc.).</p>
          <p>By clicking on search icon a string with local search appears. It works obviously, like Ctrl+F in browser or document.</p>
          <img src="http://cl.ly/image/1a3d0U2N402i/2.4%20Search.png">
          <p class="mt2">By clicking on grid icon a little popup with grid of sent or received files appears. It’s an additional but useful feature that is somewise missed in most chat apps with file transfer functionality. </p>

        <h3>Status and User Settings</h3>
         <p>By clicking on the User Area in the sidebar context menu with status options appears. We may place here some service related things (like settings, help, about etc) as well. </p>
	       <img src="http://cl.ly/image/0I3n3O0Z1F3F/3.1%20Status%20Menu.png">
        <p class="mt2">User can set the custom status by clicking on appropriate item in context menu and typing the status message.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
         <p class="mb3">Initially chat apps is very conservative area where users have deep-seated habits and it’s better to keep them as they are. We have combined the best practices and patterns in a lightweight and clean UI where additional functionality can be added painlessly in future.</p>
